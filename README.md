### FizzBuzz logic
Java 8 provides the IntStream interface. We have used the following 
two methods of the IntStream interface.

rangeClosed() Method: Returns a sequential ordered

- In this method we specify the starting number (1) and ending 
number (100 or num)

mapToObj() Method: Returns an object-valued consisting of the 
results of applying the given function to the elements of this 
stream

- In this method we check if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 
to return "FizzBuzz", divisible only by 3 to return "Fizz", 
divisible only by 5 to return "Buzz" or else return the number itself

forEach Method: Performs an action for each element of this stream

- In this method we print the returned values

### Dockerfile explanation

FROM: The keyword FROM, tells Docker to use a given image with 
its tag as build-base. If this image is not in the local 
library, an online-search on DockerHub, or on any other 
configured remote-registry, is performed

ARG JAR_FILE: Is the variable that contains the jar file

COPY: We let Docker copy our jar file into the image

ENTRYPOINT: This will be the executable to start when 
the container is booting. We must define them as JSON-Array, 
because we will use an ENTRYPOINT in combination with a CMD for 
some application arguments.

To create an image from our Dockerfile, we have to run 
â€˜docker build':
```
docker build -t fizzbuzz .
```

To run the container from our image:
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 fizzbuzz
```
We can access it from the host machine at http://localhost:8080/avaloq/fizzbuzz?num=20
